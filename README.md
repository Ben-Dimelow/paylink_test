I used the below magic getter and setter trait, to set the properties used.

## Test 3 - Magic Getter Setter

This code is mostly a minified version of https://github.com/rakshazi/getSetTrait
I want to be completely upfront that this is how I would do it and don't want think coming up with a different way would be benifical. In fact I would just use the above via composer.

I would make this a trait for this so that I could use it throughout my code where I need them.
